# The-Titanic-Disaster-Using-Logistic-Regression-To-Predict-Survival
Here, I used the simple Logistic regression to predict those who survived from the Titanic disaster. 
First I took the train set provided to create temporary train and test set so I can calculate confusion matrix. This is because the dependent vairable was not provided for the original test set or data.
After calculating our confusion matrix from the temporary test set, we now combine them back to the train set data to classify our model and predict for the original test set.

NB: This is my first machine learning repository  and your contributions will be appreciated.
